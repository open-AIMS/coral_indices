Condition,Watch,This classification indicates the habitat condition is moderate but at least one indicator is under performing. It is important to keep these reefs on watch and monitor their trajectories. ,"Cl==""Watch""",
Condition,Warning I,This classification indicates a first level of warning. Reef habitats are either not recovering as expected or certain processes are underperforming. This suggests there is an increased risk of further deterioration. ,"Cl==""Warning I""",
